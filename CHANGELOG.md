# Changelog

> **Cut date:** 2025‚Äë08‚Äë25 (Europe/London)
> **Scope:** \~45 commits touching \~60+ files across UI, state, crypto, IC integration, build, and policies.
> **Summary:** Large UI/UX refactor (Website Logins, Profile/Seed flows), reworked Vault state (IndexedDB + IC sync), crypto plumbing (vetKD + SLIP‚Äë0010), factory‚Äëfirst actor bootstrapping, and CSP/Permissions‚ÄëPolicy fixes.

---

## üöÄ Highlights

* **New Website Logins module** with full CRUD, modals, and client‚Äëside encryption.
* **Profile & Seed UX**: import / export / copy, validation for 12‚Äëword phrases.
* **Vault state rework**: unified context, IndexedDB persistence, on‚Äëdemand sync with IC, and safe bootstrapping on seed import.
* **Factory‚Äëfirst bootstrapping**: frontend initializes the Factory actor first, then resolves other canister IDs.
* **Crypto stack**: vetKD‚Äëbacked key derivation + SLIP‚Äë0010; clean AES encrypt/decrypt mapper utilities.
* **Security headers**: fixed Clipboard API via `Permissions-Policy`; CSP widened for local/dev IC endpoints.
* **Spreadsheet & Secure Notes**: refactors and MVPs aligned to new design system.

---

## üîÑ Breaking / Behavior Changes

* **Navigation default** now lands users in **Website Logins** instead of a generic home.
* **Vault reload button** added in sidebar; **disabled** when `currentVault.existsOnIc === false` (no on‚Äëchain copy to pull from).
* **Seed import** now **bootstraps vault state** immediately (initial vault selection, IDB write, and UI hydration).
* **Actor initialization order** is now **factory‚Äëfirst**; code relying on direct per‚Äëcanister IDs must adapt.

Migration checklist:

1. Replace any direct actor creation with the **factory‚Üídiscover‚Üícreate actor** flow.
2. Ensure UI events expecting an immediate vault are tolerant to a **hydration step** after seed import.
3. Confirm sidebar **Reload** respects disabled state until a vault exists on IC.

## üß≠ UI/UX Changes

### Website Logins

* **Routes & Layout**: adds a dedicated page with a two‚Äëpane or table‚Äëfirst layout (depending on viewport).
* **Modals**: standard modals for `AddSite`, `AddEntry`, and now also `RenameSite`, `EditEntry`, and `Delete` confirmations.
* **Validation**: fields validated before enabling primary action; Delete confirmations use clear danger styling.
* **Danger palette**: standardized **danger RGBA** utility to increase contrast and communicate irreversible actions.
* **Toasts**: top‚Äëcenter stacked toasts, with a high‚Äësalience variant for destructive actions ("are you sure" confirmations still in the modal itself).

### Sidebar & Profile

* **Current vault control**: next to the current vault label/button (`gk-vault-toggle`), a **kebab (vertical dots)** affordance reveals **Pencil (rename)** and **Trash (delete)** with a short slide animation.
* **Reload from IC** button: subtle, near the Profile block, full width, low‚Äëchromatic contrast ("utility" look).

  * **Enabled** only when an IC copy exists; otherwise **disabled** with a helpful tooltip.
* **Profile modal**: seed export/copy moved here; clearer warning language and spacing.

### Spreadsheet & Secure Notes

* **Spreadsheet**: refactored component boundaries (Header, Cell, ColumnHeader) with add/remove column affordances and an optional secret/plain toggle.
* **Secure Notes**: MVP with title/content pairs, using the same encryption pipeline as logins.

## üóÉÔ∏è State, Storage, and Sync

### VaultContext Rework

* Introduces a more explicit **action set** (`setActiveVault`, `upsertVault`, `loadFromIdb`, `saveToIdb`, `syncFromIc`, etc.).
* **Default/Active vault** is derived deterministically (seed ‚Üí userId ‚Üí vault namespace).
* **IDB persistence**: serialized, versioned records; write‚Äëbehind on edits and explicit saves after bulk ops.
* **Seed import bootstrap**: upon valid seed, initializes identity, derives user scope, selects/creates a local vault, and persists to IDB.

### Sync Semantics

* **Reload from IC**: pulls authoritative `VaultData` and **merges** into local state using a conflict‚Äëaware strategy (timestamp/version precedence; new cells/notes appended, deletions respected).
* **Disable logic**: `existsOnIc` gate to prevent no‚Äëop pulls.

### Race‚ÄëCondition Hardening

* **Shared HTTP Agent** and **Identity**: lazy init patterns to prevent `undefined` agent/identity during early renders; context getters return **promises** and callers `await` before actor use.
* `useEffect` guards ensure identity is set **before** vetKD/actor calls.

---

## üîê Crypto & Security

### Key Derivation

* **vetKD** integration: derivation scoped per user/org/canister (we default to **PerUser** for vault materials).
* **SLIP‚Äë0010**: deterministic HD keys from seed; used to produce intermediate keys consumed by the final AES key derivation.
* **Final key**: `deriveFinalKey(seed|vetkd) ‚Üí AESKey` (Uint8Array) with stable encoding for storage.

### Encryption Utilities

* **Mapper utilities** wrap AES‚ÄëGCM encrypt/decrypt with typed inputs/outputs for:

  * Website credentials (site‚Üíentries)
  * Secure notes
  * Spreadsheet cells/columns where `secret` type is enabled

### Clipboard & CSP

* **Clipboard API unblocked** by adding a `Permissions-Policy` header:

  ```http
  Permissions-Policy: clipboard-read=(self), clipboard-write=(self)
  ```

* **CSP** widened for local and IC hosts to avoid `connect-src` blocks during actor calls. Example baseline:

  ```http
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';
  connect-src 'self' https://icp0.io https://ic0.app http://localhost:* https://localhost:*;
  img-src 'self' data: blob:; font-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'self';
  ```

> **Note:** IC asset certification disallows dynamic nonces; prefer stable hashes or the documented strict‚Äëdynamic pattern for static bundles.

## üß© IC Integration & Build

### Factory‚ÄëFirst Bootstrapping

* **Frontend** now creates a **Factory canister actor** first.
* Retrieves other canister IDs (vault/shared/encryption) via factory methods, then instantiates those actors.
* This removes hard‚Äëcoded IDs and simplifies **environment switching**.

### `dfx.json` & Releases

* Pinned **release URLs** for factory/vault/shared `.wasm` and `.did` artifacts updated.
* Frontend canister declaration now relies on **remote declarations** + `post_install` `dfx generate` for TypeScript bindings.
* Environment export: `CANISTER_ID_FACTORY_CANISTER_BACKEND` exposed for the frontend runtime.

### Deploy/Dev Quality of Life

* Fixed an issue where playground deploys would **default to stale/frontdoor IDs**. Actor creation now always respects the exported env var.
* Added `connect-src` for `localhost` and common IC gateways to avoid **CORS/CSP** failures.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Refactors & Internal APIs

* **Context/API**: `APIContext` exposes async getters:

  ```ts
  type API = {
    getFactoryCanisterAPI(): Promise<FactoryCanisterAPI>
    getSharedVaultCanisterAPI(): Promise<SharedCanisterAPI>
    getVetKDDerivedKey(): Promise<Uint8Array>
    userExistsWithVetKD(userId: string): Promise<boolean>
  }
  ```

* **Website Logins**: normalized types `Site`, `SiteEntry` with mappers from encrypted ‚Üí view model.

* **Spreadsheet**: extracted `ColumnHeader`/`Cell` components; add‚Äëcolumn affordance near the right edge; hover‚Äëto‚Äëreveal delete icon.

* **Notes**: simple tuple `[title, body]` with encrypted storage and searchable plaintext indices (local only).

---

## üêû Fixes

* **Clipboard API blocked** ‚Üí fixed by `Permissions-Policy` and minor CSP tweak.
* **sharedHTTPAgent undefined** ‚Üí fixed with lazy init + `await`ed getters.
* **Deploy to playground** used wrong canister ID ‚Üí fixed via env‚Äëdriven actor bootstrap.
* **Seed path derivation mismatch** (bytes vs hex string) ‚Üí standardized hex inputs for SLIP‚Äë0010; added guards for invalid paths.
* **UI affordances visibility** (Pencil/Trash) ‚Üí ensured SVGs render in dark mode and respect CSS `fill`.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation & Tests (what to verify)

* **Seed import (12 words)**

  * Rejects non‚Äë12 lengths; every word must exist in the **BIP‚Äë39 English** list.
  * On success, identity is created, vault is bootstrapped, and IDB persisted.
* **Website Logins**

  * Add/Rename/Delete site; Add/Edit/Delete entry; ensure data round‚Äëtrips via encryption mappers.
  * Danger modal shows; toast confirms.
* **Reload from IC**

  * Disabled until `existsOnIc` flips true; on enabled pull, merges without duplications or lost deletions.
* **Spreadsheet**

  * Add column (secret/plain), delete rows with hover affordance, maintain N filled + 5 empty rows policy.
* **Secure Notes**

  * Create/edit/delete; verify AES round‚Äëtrip and local search index works.
* **Network policies**

  * Clipboard read/write works on supported browsers.
  * No CSP violations when calling IC actors (dev + ic gateways).

---

## üß≠ Developer Notes

* On IC, **auth is caller‚Äëprincipal based**; client must create `HttpAgent` only after identity is ready.
* Avoid keeping **plaintext secrets** in React state longer than necessary; encrypt at boundaries and keep only view models in memory.
* For asset canisters, keep headers **static** and use **hash‚Äëbased CSP** where possible.
